# my-work-contributions
to give you information about your work contributions to your organization.

## Why create this?

The reason why I'm creating this simple project is to review and reflect on what I've done during my work for my employer. . Hopefully after the reflection I can be better at work and give my best for my employer.

## Integration
This project is integrated with multiple 3rd party such as:
- Github
- JIRA
The reason is that I mainly use those tools at work. In the future, there may be additional integration with other tools and services but for now, I'll make it as simple as possible.

## What does this project actually do
This project will give you information about your contribution to your employer. What I mean by that is this project can produce a report that gives you information such as:
- What are Github PRs that you've created?
- What are Github issues that you've raised?
- What are JIRA issues that were assigned to you and you successfully solved them?
The list can be grown. Suggestion for improvement to this project is welcome :)
